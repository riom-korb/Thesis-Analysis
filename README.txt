This package contains my analysis code for my Master's thesis.  It will not run on its own because it was built to work within the RootCore framework developed by ATLAS members and beta tested in part by me.  RootCore is a ROOT based framework that allows users to access ATLAS data across their world wide computing grid.

The Root folder contains all the classes that were needed to select the events I was interested in and analyse them.  The Smearing folder contains all the header files for the classes contained in the Root folder.
