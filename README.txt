This package contains a sample of the analysis code for my Master's thesis.  It will not run on its own because it was built to work within the RootCore framework developed by ATLAS members and tested by researchers such as myself.  RootCore is written in C++ and allows researchers to utilize the ROOT based framework to analyze the ATLAS Collaboration's data across a world wide computing grid.

The Root folder contains a class that selects and records only events I am interested in.  The Smearing folder contains all the header files for the classes contained in the Root folder.
